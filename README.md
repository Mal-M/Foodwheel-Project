# Foodwheel-Project
FoodWheel is a startup delivery service that takes away the struggle of deciding where to eat! 
Using Data Analysis we'll answer several key questions:
- What cuisines does FoodWheel offer?
- Which areas should the company search for more restaurants to partner with?
- How has the average order amount changed over time?
- What does this say about the trajectory of the company?
- How much has each customer on FoodWheel spent over the past six months?
- What can this tell us about the average FoodWheel customer?
